Robo House was created in 2010 by me, Kevin Wynn. At the beginning it served as a place for me to hone my development skills. Providing me a domain for working on personal projects.

Fast forward to today and it is the house I keep all my freelancing and contract work under. After working as a designer for 4 years and as a developer for over a decade I have gained a huge amount of professional skills that I would like to take to the next level.

Starting Robo House to become the best provider of custom web design and web development in Waco, TX is that next.

After moving here in 2023, the hometown of my wife, I find it may be a great opportunity for me to help lay roots and build my connections.

## What I Offer

If its online, I can provide for it. From extremely complex problems of scaling your infrastructure to millions of users, to simpler tasks of setting up your Wordpress hosting and growing your online traffic. A more comprehensive list would be:

- Web/App Design
- Custom website development (Wordpress)
- Website hosting
- SEO & PPC
- Custom Wordpress plugin functionality
- iOS or Android application development
- See in more detail on our [Services](/services) page

## My Approach to Web Development

I like to look at web development in 3-4 phases depending on what you need.

1. **Brainstorming and design**: we get to find out together your end goals in mind. What you want things to look like, what functionality you need.
2. **Development**: I get started building everything providing you a live development version to check out.
3. **Launch and build out SEO/PPC**: we launch the site and begin working on tweaking our SEO and PPC to drive traffic.
4. **Maintenance**: as time goes on we may need to do regular maintenance, keeping things updated provides security and as other platforms change we may need to tweak things to keep things in line.
