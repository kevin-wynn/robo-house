this is robo house.

not a portfolio. not a brand. not a startup. just a place.

i build things — [loggy](https://loggy.dev), [badcatch](https://badcatch.com), [lisq](https://lisq.io), [cadiv](https://cadiv.cc) — and this is the space between all of that. the experimental side. the late night stuff. the ideas that don't have a home yet.

robo house is me when I'm not trying to be anything.

more words coming. stay tuned.
