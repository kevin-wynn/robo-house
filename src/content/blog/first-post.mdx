This is Robo House.

Not a portfolio. Not a brand. Not a startup. Just a place.

I build things — [Loggy](https://loggy.dev), [Badcatch](https://badcatch.com), [Lisq](https://lisq.io), [Cadiv](https://cardiv.cc) — and this is the space between all of that. The experimental side. The late night stuff. The ideas that don't have a home yet.

Robo House is me when I'm not trying to be anything.

More words coming. Stay tuned.
