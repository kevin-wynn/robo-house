damn. ai. wild concept. never heard of it.

oh wait — yes i have. every single day. from every single person. on every single platform. in every single conversation. in my email. in my slack. in my dreams probably. ai ai ai ai ai ai.

look — it's good. genuinely. i'm not out here saying it's trash. it slaps in the right contexts. cool tool. love a cool tool. you're good, dude. don't worry about it.

but like. *really?* you're gonna be in everything?

you know that thing that happens with actors? some new person comes out, they're incredible, you love them, you're telling everyone about them — and then six months later they're in every single movie dropping at the same time and suddenly you don't even wanna see their face anymore? it's not that they got worse. it's that the studios just... wouldn't chill. couldn't let it breathe. had to squeeze every last drop until you're just numb to it.

that's ai right now.

the moment something gets talked about *this* much, i check out. not because it's bad. because i'm a human being and i have a finite amount of attention and you just burned through all of it by being inescapable. congrats.

and while we're here — if you're the type of person who asks ai how to respond to another human being and then just... copies what it says and sends it to me?

fuck you.

be a person. talk to me like a person. i don't want the machine's version of you. i want *you*, even if you're awkward, even if you don't know what to say. that's the whole point. that's what makes it mean something.

using ai to talk to humans is the most dystopian thing we've normalized and nobody's even flinching.

anyway. ai is cool. we get it. stfu now.
